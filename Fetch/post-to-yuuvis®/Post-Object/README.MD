To use this import script, you'll have to update your schema with an object type that does not require content, so that the import process can be split up into a pure metadata import and a content update. This script looks for a metadata file called 'metadata_nocontent.json' that does not specify a content stream that it will import to yuuvisÂ®. From the response of that import, it extracts the objectId attribute value of the newly created object and builds a URL using that value to supply the object with the desired content. This is useful when a library does not support binary multipart requests.
